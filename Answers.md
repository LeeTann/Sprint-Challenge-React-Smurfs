1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client-side routing is when routing is handled internally by javascript to maintain state on the app and tells the browser what to display on request. Client side routing doesnt refresh the page and is really fast once the whole webpage is laoded. Server side routing is when we click on a link and request information from the server. Server side routing refreshes the page and can be really slow if a lot of information is requested.
